I often get asked why I run servers in my closet. "Why not just use AWS?"

## Full Stack Infrastructure

As developers, we often live in the application layer. We write code and push it. But we rarely see what happens underneath.
- How does DNS actually work?
- What happens when a disk fails?
- How do you configure a firewall from scratch?

## The Sandbox

A home lab gives you a safe place to break things.
- Want to learn Kubernetes? Spin up a cluster.
- Want to try a new database? Deploy it in a container.

## Career Impact

The skills I learned in my lab—Linux administration, networking, Docker, security—have saved me countless times in my day job. It turns you from a "coder" into a "systems thinker."
