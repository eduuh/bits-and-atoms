After years of tweaking, I've finally settled on a keyboard layout that minimizes finger travel and maximizes comfort.

## The Base Layer: Colemak Mod-DH

I switched from QWERTY to **Colemak Mod-DH** about two years ago.
- **Home Row Comfort:** The most common letters (E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R) are all on the home row.
- **Reduced Lateral Movement:** My fingers rarely have to stretch sideways.

## The Navigation Layer

I hate moving my hand to the arrow keys. So, I hold down `Caps Lock` (mapped to `Layer 1`) to turn H/J/K/L into arrow keys.
- `Caps + H`: Left
- `Caps + J`: Down
- `Caps + K`: Up
- `Caps + L`: Right

## The Symbols Layer

Reaching for `Shift + 1` to type `!` is painful. On my layout, I have a dedicated symbols layer activated by my right thumb.
- `Thumb + Q`: !
- `Thumb + W`: @
- `Thumb + E`: #

## Conclusion

It took about a month to regain my typing speed, but the ergonomic benefits were worth it immediately. My wrists no longer hurt after a long day of coding.
