It had been a while since I touched C code. QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware is written in C, and diving back in was both nostalgic and challenging.

## Setting Up the Environment

The first hurdle was setting up the build environment. QMK MSYS (on Windows) or just standard tools on macOS/Linux.

## Keymaps.c

The heart of your customization lives in `keymaps.c`. This is where you define your layers, your keycodes, and your custom functions.

## Advanced Features

I started exploring features like:
- **Tap Dance:** Doing different things based on how many times you tap a key.
- **Combos:** Pressing multiple keys at once to trigger an action.
- **Leader Key:** Sequences of keys to trigger macros.

Re-learning QMK gave me total control over my input device. It's a powerful feeling to mold your tool to fit your exact needs.
