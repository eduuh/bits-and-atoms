Kubernetes (K8s) has a reputation for being over-engineered for small setups. But once you get past the learning curve, the declarative nature of it is unbeatable.

## K3s: The Lightweight Distro

I use K3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution built for IoT and Edge computing. It's perfect for a home lab.

## The Core Concepts

I don't need to be a K8s expert. I just focus on:
- **Deployments:** Keeping my apps running.
- **Services:** Exposing apps internally.
- **Ingress:** Exposing apps to the web (via Traefik or Nginx).
- **PVCs:** Persistent Volume Claims for storage.

## GitOps with ArgoCD

The real magic happens with GitOps. I commit my K8s manifests to a Git repo, and ArgoCD automatically syncs the state of my cluster. If I break something, I just revert the commit.
