Most people use the keyboard that came with their computer. Some buy a "mechanical" keyboard for the clicky noise. I use a programmable keyboard because I want to control the tool, not let the tool control me.

## The Hardware

I currently drive a custom split keyboard running on an RP2040 microcontroller.
- **Split Design:** Keeps my shoulders open and improves posture.
- **Ortholinear Layout:** Keys are arranged in a grid, not staggered like a typewriter from 1870.
- **QMK Firmware:** The brain of the operation.

## Why Programmable?

A standard keyboard sends a scancode to the OS, and the OS decides what letter to print. A programmable keyboard decides what to send before it even leaves the board.

### Layers
I don't have a number pad. I don't have function keys. I don't even have arrow keys on the base layer.
Instead, I have layers.
- **Layer 0:** Alphas (Colemak Mod-DH)
- **Layer 1:** Navigation (Vim-style arrows, Home, End)
- **Layer 2:** Numbers and Symbols
- **Layer 3:** Media and System Control

### Macros
I have single keys that:
- Type my email address.
- Lock my screen and turn off the monitors.
- Git commit and push.

## The Result

My hands barely move. Everything I need is within one unit of the home row. It's not just about speed; it's about comfort and cognitive load. Once you go programmable, you can't go back to a "dumb" slab of plastic.
