I remember when I first decided to learn touch typing. It wasn't just about speed; it was about reducing the friction between my thoughts and the screen.

## The Beginning

Like many, I started with a "hunt and peck" style, eventually graduating to a chaotic multi-finger method that was fast but error-prone.

## The Transition

Switching to proper touch typing was frustrating at first. My speed dropped significantly. But I stuck with it, using tools like Keybr and Monkeytype to practice daily.

## The Result

Now, typing feels invisible. It's no longer a bottleneck. This journey laid the foundation for my interest in keyboards and ergonomics.
