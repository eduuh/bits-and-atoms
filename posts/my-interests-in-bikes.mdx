There is something uniquely liberating about riding a bike. It's just you, the machine, and the road (or trail).

## The Beginning

My interest in bikes started young, like most kids, as a way to get around the neighborhood. But it evolved into a passion for the mechanics and the physical challenge.

## Mountain Biking

I love the technical aspect of mountain biking. Picking a line, managing traction, and the adrenaline of a descent. It's a full-body workout that demands total focus.

## Road Cycling

On the flip side, road cycling is meditative. It's about rhythm, endurance, and covering distance. It's the best way to explore a new area.

## The Gear

Of course, I can't ignore the gear. Maintaining my bikes, upgrading components, and understanding the geometry is half the fun.
