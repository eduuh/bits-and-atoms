Water pressure issues can be just as frustrating as power cuts. Here is how I solved my water supply challenges.

## The Problem

Inconsistent municipal water pressure meant that showers were hit-or-miss, and sometimes the tank wouldn't fill up.

## The Setup

I installed a pressure-controlled pump system with a large buffer tank.
- **Buffer Tank:** Stores water when municipal supply is available.
- **Smart Pump:** Maintains constant pressure in the house pipes, regardless of flow rate.
- **Float Switches:** Protect the pump from running dry and automate the tank filling.

## Automation

I integrated the pump controller with my home assistant setup (more on that later) to monitor water usage and detect leaks.
