If you can't measure it, you can't manage it. In my home lab, I take this to the extreme.

## The Stack

- **Prometheus:** The time-series database that scrapes metrics from my targets.
- **Grafana:** The beautiful visualization layer.
- **Node Exporter:** Running on every Linux box to report system stats.

## What I Monitor

1.  **Server Health:** CPU, RAM, Disk usage across my Proxmox cluster.
2.  **Network Traffic:** Real-time bandwidth usage from OPNsense.
3.  **Power:** Energy consumption from my smart plugs and backup inverter.
4.  **Environment:** Temperature and humidity in the server closet.

## The "God Mode" Dashboard

I built a single "God Mode" dashboard that gives me a red/green status for every service I run. It's the first thing I check in the morning.
