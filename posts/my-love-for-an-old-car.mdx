In an era where cars are becoming increasingly like smartphones on wheels, there is something grounding about driving a machine that is purely mechanical.

## The Connection

When I drive my old car, I feel everything.
- The vibration of the engine through the shifter.
- The texture of the road through the steering wheel.
- The smell of gasoline and old leather.

There is no lane-keep assist to nudge me back. No automatic braking to save me. It demands my full attention, and in return, it gives me a sense of control that modern cars simply cannot match.

## The Flaws are Features

It leaks a little oil. The AC is temperamental. The radio only plays cassettes. But these aren't bugs; they are character traits. They remind me that this machine has lived a life before me, and with enough care, it will live a life after me.

## Preservation

Driving an old car is an act of preservation. It's about keeping history alive on the road, rather than letting it rot in a museum or a scrapyard. Every repair is a small victory against entropy.
