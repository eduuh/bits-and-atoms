Before I bought a programmable keyboard, I wanted to see how much I could improve my experience just with software.

## Karabiner-Elements (macOS)

On macOS, Karabiner-Elements is a game changer. I started by mapping Caps Lock to Escape (when tapped) and Control (when held). This simple change made Vim usage so much more comfortable.

## KMonad

Later, I discovered KMonad, which offers even more power and is cross-platform. It allows for complex layers and tap-hold behaviors that mimic QMK features, but on any keyboard.

## Why Software?

Software remapping is great because it travels with your computer, not your keyboard. It's the perfect gateway drug into the world of keyboard customization.
