I hate manual deployments. They are slow, error-prone, and boring. Here is how I automated everything.

## The Workflow

1.  **Write:** I write a post in MDX and commit it to the `main` branch.
2.  **Test:** GitHub Actions spins up, runs linting, type checking, and unit tests.
3.  **Build:** If tests pass, it builds a Docker image of the Next.js app.
4.  **Deploy:** The image is pushed to my container registry, and my production server pulls the new image and restarts the container.

## Key Tools

- **GitHub Actions:** The CI/CD runner.
- **Docker:** Ensuring the environment is consistent from dev to prod.
- **Watchtower (or similar):** Automatically updating running containers when a new image is available.

Now, publishing a post is as simple as `git push`.
