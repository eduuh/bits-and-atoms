While my current backup system works well, there is always room for improvement. The next phase focuses on sustainability and efficiency.

## Solar Integration

The biggest upgrade will be adding solar panels. This will:
- Reduce electricity bills.
- Charge batteries during the day for night-time use.
- Provide true energy independence during prolonged outages.

## Smart Load Management

I plan to implement smart breakers to prioritize loads.
- **Critical Loads:** Lights, internet, fridge (Always on).
- **Non-Critical:** AC, heavy appliances (Shed when on battery).

## Monitoring

Improving the data visualization with Grafana to track generation vs. consumption in real-time.
