Owning a vintage car like KAL means dealing with "NLA" (No Longer Available) parts. A broken plastic clip can be a showstopper.

## The Problem

A specific trim clip on the dashboard snapped. I searched eBay, forums, and junkyards. Nothing.

## The Solution: Reverse Engineering

1.  **Measurement:** I took the broken pieces and measured them with digital calipers.
2.  **CAD Design:** I modeled the part in Fusion 360.
3.  **Prototyping:** I printed a test version in PLA to check the fit.
4.  **Final Part:** I printed the final version in ASA (which is UV and heat resistant, perfect for cars).

## The Result

The part fits perfectly and is stronger than the original 30-year-old plastic. This is the future of classic car preservation.
