In the mechanical keyboard community, we talk about the "End Game"—the one keyboard to rule them all, after which you'll never need to buy another.

## It's a Lie

I've built 60% boards, split ergo boards, heavy brass boards, and travel boards. Each time, I thought, "This is it."

## Changing Needs

The reality is that your needs change.
- Sometimes I want the productivity of a split keyboard with QMK layers.
- Sometimes I want the satisfying "thock" of a heavy custom board.
- Sometimes I just need something portable for a coffee shop.

## Embracing the Variety

I've learned to stop looking for the perfect keyboard and start appreciating the rotation. The "End Game" isn't a product; it's the knowledge you gain along the way.
