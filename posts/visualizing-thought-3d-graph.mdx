  A technical deep dive into how I built the interactive 3D knowledge graph for
  this blog using D3.js and React Force Graph.

One of the signature features of this blog is the `/graph` page—a 3D visualization of how all my posts and tags connect.

## The Concept

I wanted to move away from the linear list of blog posts. Knowledge isn't linear; it's a web.

## The Tech Stack

- **React Force Graph:** A powerful library that handles the physics simulation (nodes repelling, links attracting).
- **Next.js API:** I generate a JSON representation of my posts (nodes) and their internal links (edges) at build time.

## The Challenges

1.  **Performance:** Rendering hundreds of nodes in WebGL without crashing the browser.
2.  **Navigation:** Making the graph clickable so it acts as a navigation menu.
3.  **Mobile:** Ensuring it works on touch screens (or gracefully degrades).

## Why It Matters

It helps readers discover related content they might have missed and gives a bird's-eye view of what I write about most.
