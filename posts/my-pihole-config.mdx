The internet is full of ads and trackers. Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content without installing any client-side software.

## The Setup

I run Pi-hole as a container in my Home Lab (though it runs great on a Raspberry Pi too).

## Recursive DNS with Unbound

Instead of forwarding DNS queries to Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), I use Unbound as a recursive DNS resolver.
- **Privacy:** No single company sees my DNS history.
- **Security:** DNSSEC validation is handled locally.

## Regex Blocking

Standard blocklists are great, but Regex allows for powerful pattern matching. I use it to block entire domains of tracking servers and mobile ads.

## Local DNS

Pi-hole also serves as my local DNS server, allowing me to access services via `plex.home.arpa` instead of remembering IP addresses.
