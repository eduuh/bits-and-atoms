The ultimate goal is a home that anticipates needs rather than just responding to commands.

## The Brain: Home Assistant

I am betting on Home Assistant as the central nervous system. Its local-first approach and massive compatibility list make it the only viable choice for a serious setup.

## Integration Points

- **Lighting:** Circadian rhythm lighting that adjusts color temperature throughout the day.
- **Climate:** Zone-based heating and cooling based on occupancy.
- **Security:** AI-powered object detection on cameras (Frigate).
- **Voice:** Local voice control to replace cloud-based assistants.

## Philosophy

A smart home shouldn't require a phone to operate. It should use sensors (presence, temperature, humidity) to act autonomously, fading into the background.
