In a world of touchscreens and autonomous driving features, I find solace in my old car, affectionately named "KAL".

## Meeting KAL

KAL isn't just a mode of transport; it's a member of the family. It has quirks, rattles, and a personality that no modern car can match.

## The Analog Experience

Driving KAL is an engaging experience. No power steering, a manual transmission, and a direct mechanical connection to the road. You have to *drive* it, not just operate it.

## Maintenance and Restoration

Owning an old car is a labor of love.
- **Wrenching:** I do most of the maintenance myself. It's therapeutic to fix something with your hands.
- **The Hunt:** Scouring forums and junkyards for rare parts is an adventure in itself.

## Why Keep It?

It reminds me to slow down. It's a capsule of a different time, where design was about character rather than just aerodynamics and efficiency.
