Commercial smart home sensors are often overpriced, cloud-dependent, and limited in functionality. Enter the ESP32.

## What is ESPHome?

ESPHome is a system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 by simple configuration files. No C++ coding required (unless you want to).

## My Custom Sensors

1.  **The "Everything" Sensor:** A small box with temperature, humidity, lux (light), and presence detection (mmWave). Total cost: ~$15.
2.  **Bed Presence:** Pressure mats under the mattress to know if I'm in bed (automating lights and night mode).
3.  **Energy Monitoring:** CT clamps on my main breaker panel to track whole-home usage.

## Reliability

Because they communicate over local WiFi (or even Ethernet) and integrate directly with Home Assistant, they are faster and more reliable than most Zigbee/Z-Wave alternatives.
