I've been tracking my rides on Strava for years. That's a goldmine of data waiting to be explored.

## The Strava API

Strava has a great API that lets you pull all your activities. I wrote a Python script to fetch my entire history.

## What I Found

Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I visualized:
- **Yearly Mileage:** Am I actually riding more?
- **Speed vs. Elevation:** How much does climbing really slow me down?
- **Heatmaps:** Which routes do I take the most?

## Data-Driven Training

Seeing the data helped me realize I was plateauing because I wasn't varying my intensity. I used this insight to structure a better training plan.
