Software remapping was powerful, but I eventually hit a ceiling. I wanted hardware that was designed to be customized.

## The First Mechanical Keyboard

I started with a standard 60% mechanical keyboard. The feeling of the switches was an upgrade, but the layout was still standard staggered.

## Going Split

My wrists started to complain, so I looked into split keyboards. The ergonomic benefits were immediately apparent, opening up my chest and straightening my wrists.

## The Ortholinear Shift

Moving from staggered to ortholinear (grid layout) was another learning curve, but it made so much sense for touch typing. Keys were exactly where my fingers expected them to be.
