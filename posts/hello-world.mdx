# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is a sample post to demonstrate the link preview functionality.

You can hover over links to see a preview of the content without leaving the page.

## Features

- **MDX Support**: Write content in Markdown with React components.<Footnote id={1}>MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content, making it incredibly powerful for technical blogging.</Footnote>
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks are beautifully highlighted.
- **Hover Previews**: See what a post is about before clicking.

## Footnotes and Sidenotes

This blog supports inline footnotes and sidenotes for adding supplementary information without disrupting the main flow of content.

Click on the numbered footnote markers to see additional context.<Footnote id={2}>Footnotes appear as popups on click, making them perfect for citations, clarifications, or tangential thoughts.</Footnote>

<Sidenote id={1} label="Pro tip">
On larger screens, sidenotes appear in the margin for easy reference. On mobile, they expand inline when tapped.
</Sidenote>

You can use sidenotes for commentary that enriches the reading experience without breaking the narrative flow.

Enjoy reading!
