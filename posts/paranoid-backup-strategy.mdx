I have terabytes of data: photos, documents, code, and media. Losing it would be catastrophic.

## The 3-2-1 Rule

- **3 Copies of Data**
- **2 Different Media Types**
- **1 Offsite Copy**

## My Implementation

1.  **Live Data:** Lives on my PC (NVMe SSD) and Proxmox VMs.
2.  **Local Backup (NAS):** TrueNAS Scale with ZFS.
    - **Snapshots:** Taken every 15 minutes. I can roll back any file instantly.
    - **RAID-Z2:** I can lose 2 hard drives without losing data.
3.  **Offsite Backup:**
    - **Critical Data:** Encrypted and pushed to Backblaze B2 nightly via Restic.
    - **Media:** Synced to a remote NAS at a friend's house (we swap backup space).

## Testing Restores

A backup is only as good as your ability to restore it. I schedule monthly "fire drills" where I try to recover a random file or VM to ensure the system works.
