I spend 8+ hours a day on my computer. Dragging windows around with a mouse feels like a waste of time.

## What is a Tiling Window Manager?

Unlike standard "floating" window managers, a tiling WM automatically arranges your windows in a non-overlapping grid. Open a new window, and the others resize to make room.

## The macOS Solution: Yabai

macOS doesn't support this natively. I use **Yabai**, a tiling window manager for Mac.
- **Automatic Layout:** Windows snap into place instantly.
- **Focus Follows Mouse:** No need to click to activate a window.

## The Controller: SKHD

Yabai handles the layout, but **SKHD** handles the shortcuts.
- `Alt + H/J/K/L`: Move focus between windows (Vim style).
- `Alt + Shift + Enter`: Rotate the layout.
- `Alt + 1-9`: Switch workspaces instantly.

It takes a week to get used to, but once you do, you can't go back.
