Keyboard accessibility is crucial for power users and those with disabilities.

## Common Shortcuts

Here are some shortcuts you might use every day:

- Copy: <Kbd>Cmd</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd>
- Paste: <Kbd>Cmd</Kbd> + <Kbd>V</Kbd>
- Open Command Palette: <Kbd>Cmd</Kbd> + <Kbd>Shift</Kbd> + <Kbd>P</Kbd>

## The Kbd Component

We created a custom `<Kbd>` component to visualize these keys. It adds a nice border and background to make them pop.

```tsx
<Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
```

This renders as: <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>

## Why it matters

Using visual cues for keyboard shortcuts helps users learn them faster. It also breaks up the text and makes documentation more engaging.
