Living in an area with occasional power instability led me to design and implement a robust power backup system.

## The Challenge

Frequent power cuts were disrupting my work and daily life. I needed a solution that could switch over instantly and sustain critical loads for extended periods.

## The Solution

I opted for a hybrid inverter system coupled with LiFePO4 batteries. This setup offers:
- **Instant Switchover:** Computers don't even blink.
- **Long Cycle Life:** LiFePO4 batteries last for thousands of cycles.
- **Solar Integration:** The inverter is ready for future solar panel addition.

## Components

- **Inverter:** 5kW Hybrid Inverter
- **Battery:** 5.12kWh LiFePO4 Battery Bank
- **Protection:** Surge protection devices and proper fusing.

This system has been a game-changer, providing peace of mind and continuous uptime.
