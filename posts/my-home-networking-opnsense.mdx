The router provided by your ISP is usually garbage. It lacks features, security updates, and performance. That's why I switched to OPNsense.

## Why OPNsense?

OPNsense is an open-source, FreeBSD-based firewall and routing platform. It's a fork of pfSense but with a cleaner UI and a more open development model.

## Hardware

I'm running OPNsense on a dedicated mini-PC with dual 2.5GbE NICs. This ensures it can handle my full internet bandwidth with Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS) enabled.

## Key Features I Use

- **VLANs:** Segregating IoT devices from my main network.
- **VPN:** WireGuard for secure remote access to my home network.
- **Traffic Shaping:** Ensuring gaming and video calls get priority over downloads.
