Buying a programmable keyboard is one thing; programming it is another. Most come with GUIs like VIA or Vial, which are fantastic. But I wanted more control.

## Beyond the GUI

GUIs are great for quick changes, but they hide the complexity. I wanted to understand how the matrix scanning worked, how keycodes were processed, and how to implement custom logic.

## The Matrix

Understanding the row-column matrix was my first "aha" moment. It demystified how the microcontroller knows which key is pressed.

## Custom Logic

I started writing small snippets of C code to handle specific behaviors that the GUI couldn't support, like dynamic macros or complex state management.
